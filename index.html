    <section>
        <p>
            I am currently a postgraduate of computer science at
            <a href="https://www.ustc.edu.cn/"> University of Science
                and Technology of China</a>.
            I major in data mining at
            <a href="https://bigdata.ustc.edu.cn/">Anhui Province Key
                Laboratory of Big Data Analysis and
                Application</a>
            and my tutor is <a
                href="http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~qiliuql/">Dr. Qi Liu</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            My research interests include Deep Learning (<b>DL</b>),
            Knowledge Graph (<b>KG</b>), Natural Language Processing
            (<b>NLP</b>) and Reinforcement Learning (<b>RL</b>).
            By now, I already have two papers
            published in <b>AAAI'19</b> and <b>KDD'19</b>,
            and one related to NLP is under review.
            Also, I have one received patent
            and two are under review.
            I also develop a toolkit framework
            to quickly construct different architectures
            for different purposes,
            named <a
                href="https://longling.readthedocs.io/zh/latest/index.html">longling</a>,
            which is still in progress.
            Recently, I am responsible for constructing knowledge graphs
            for my laboratory.
        </p>

            I am familiar with
            <b>python</b>, and know the basic grammar of
            <b>C</b>,
            <b>java</b>,
            <b>html</b>,
            <b>javascript</b>.
            I grasp the basic usage of some common
            frameworks for development like
            <b>webpack</b>, <b>vue</b> in frontend,
            <b>flask</b> in backend and
            <b>beautifulsoup</b> for crawling.
            I have some experience on managing servers (CentOS)
            and database,
            knowing the basic usage of
            <b>mysql</b>,
            <b>neo4j</b>,
            <b>mongodb</b>, and
            <b>elasticsearch</b>.
            In addition, I know <b>git</b>, <b>kafka</b>, <b>thrift</b> and used
            <b>spark</b> and
            <b>hive</b>
            but be out of practice currently.
            My most favorite machine learning frameworks are
            <a href="https://scikit-learn.org/">sklearn</a> and <a
                href="https://mxnet.apache.org/">mxnet</a>.

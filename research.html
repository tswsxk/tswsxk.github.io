                    Recent years, Chinese text
                    classification has attracted more and more research
                    attention. However, most existing techniques which
                    specifically aim at English materials may lose effectiveness
                    on this task due to the huge difference between
                    Chinese and English. Actually, as a special kind of
                    hieroglyphics, Chinese characters and radicals are
                    semantically useful but still unexplored in the task of text
                    classification. To that end, in this paper, we
                    first analyze the motives of using multiple granularity
                    features to represent a Chinese text
                    by inspecting the characteristics of radicals, characters
                    and words. For better representing the Chinese
                    text and then implementing Chinese text classification, we
                    propose a novel Radical-aware Attention-based
                    Four-Granularity (RAFG) model to take full advantages of
                    Chinese characters, words, character-level
                    radicals, word-level radicals simultaneously. Specifically,
                    RAFG applies a serialized BLSTM structure
                    which is context-aware and able to capture the long-range
                    information to model the character sharing
                    property of Chinese and sequence characteristics in texts.
                    Further, we design an attention mechanism to
                    enhance the effects of radicals thus model the radical
                    sharing property when integrating granularities.
                    Finally, we conduct extensive experiments, where the
                    experimental results not only show the superiority of
                    our model, but also validate the effectiveness of radicals
                    in the task of Chinese text classification

                    Adaptive learning, also known as adaptive teaching, relies
                    on learning path recommendation,
                    which sequentially recommends personalized learning items
                    (e.g., lectures, exercises) to satisfy
                    the unique needs of each learner. Although it is well known
                    that modeling the cognitive structure including
                    knowledge level of learners and knowledge structure (e.g.,
                    the prerequisite relations)
                    of learning items is important for learning path
                    recommendation, existing methods for
                    adaptive learning often separately focus on either knowledge
                    levels of learners or knowledge structure
                    of learning items. To fully exploit the multifaceted
                    cognitive structure for learning path recommendation,
                    in this paper, we propose a
                    <b>C</b>ognitive
                    <b>S</b>tructure
                    <b>E</b>nhanced
                    framework
                    <b>A</b>daptive
                    <b>L</b>earning,
                    named <b>CSEAL</b>.
                    By viewing path recommendation as a Markov Decision Process
                    (MDP) and applying an actor-critic algorithm, our framework
                    can sequentially identify the right learning items to
                    different learners. Specifically, we first utilize a
                    recurrent neural network to
                    trace the evolving knowledge levels of learners at each
                    learning step. Then, we design a navigation algorithm on
                    knowledge graph to
                    ensure the logicality of learning paths, which can also
                    reduce the search space in the decision process.
                    Finally, the actor-critic algorithm is used to determine
                    what to learn next, whose parameters are dynamically updated
                    along the learning path. Extensive experiments with
                    real-world data demonstrate the
                    effectiveness and robustness of CSEAL in comparison with
                    alternative approaches.

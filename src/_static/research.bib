    Cognitive diagnosis, a fundamental task in education area, aims at providing an approach to reveal the proficiency level of students on knowledge concepts. Actually, monotonicity is one of the basic conditions in cognitive diagnosis theory, which assumes that student's proficiency is monotonic with the probability of giving the right response to a test item. However, few of previous methods consider the monotonicity during optimization. To this end, we propose Item Response Ranking framework (IRR), aiming at introducing pairwise learning into cognitive diagnosis to well model the monotonicity between item responses. Specifically, we first use an item specific sampling method to sample item responses and construct response pairs based on their partial order, where we propose the two-branch sampling methods to handle the unobserved responses. After that, we use a pairwise objective function to exploit the monotonicity in the pair formulation. In fact, IRR is a general framework which can be applied to most of contemporary cognitive diagnosis models. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and interpretability of our method.

  abstract={
    Knowledge Tracing (KT) is a fundamental but challenging task in online education that traces learners' evolving knowledge states.
    Much attention has been drawn to this area and several works such as Bayesian and Deep Knowledge Tracing have been proposed.
    Recent works have explored the value of relations among concepts and proposed to introduce knowledge structure into KT tasks.
    However, the propagated influence among concepts, which has been shown to be a key factor in human learning by the educational theories, is still under-explored.
    In this paper, we propose a new framework called Structure-based Knowledge Tracing (SKT), which exploits the multiple relations in knowledge structure to model the influence propagation among concepts.
    In the SKT framework, we consider both the temporal effect on the exercising sequence and the spatial effect on the knowledge structure.
    We take advantages of two novel formulations in modeling the influence propagation on the knowledge structure with multiple relations.
    For undirected relations such as similarity relations, the synchronization propagation method is adopted, where the influence propagates bidirectionally between neighbor concepts.
    For directed relations such as prerequisite relations, the partial propagation method is applied, where the influence can only unidirectionally propagate from a predecessor to a successor.
    Meanwhile, we employ the gated functions to update the states of concepts temporally and spatially.
    We demonstrate the effectiveness and interpretability of SKT with extensive experiments.

  abstract={
    Adaptive learning, also known as adaptive teaching, relies
    on learning path recommendation,
    which sequentially recommends personalized learning items
    (e.g., lectures, exercises) to satisfy
    the unique needs of each learner. Although it is well known
    that modeling the cognitive structure including
    knowledge level of learners and knowledge structure (e.g.,
    the prerequisite relations)
    of learning items is important for learning path
    recommendation, existing methods for
    adaptive learning often separately focus on either knowledge
    levels of learners or knowledge structure
    of learning items. To fully exploit the multifaceted
    cognitive structure for learning path recommendation,
    in this paper, we propose a

    <b>E</b>nhanced
    framework
    <b>A</b>daptive
    <b>L</b>earning,
    named <b>CSEAL</b>.
    By viewing path recommendation as a Markov Decision Process
    (MDP) and applying an actor-critic algorithm, our framework
    can sequentially identify the right learning items to
    different learners. Specifically, we first utilize a
    recurrent neural network to
    trace the evolving knowledge levels of learners at each
    learning step. Then, we design a navigation algorithm on
    knowledge graph to
    ensure the logicality of learning paths, which can also
    reduce the search space in the decision process.
    Finally, the actor-critic algorithm is used to determine
    what to learn next, whose parameters are dynamically updated
    along the learning path. Extensive experiments with
    real-world data demonstrate the
    effectiveness and robustness of CSEAL in comparison with
    alternative approaches.

  abstract={
    Cognitive psychology research shows that humans have the instinct for abstract thinking, where association plays an essential role in language comprehension. Especially for Chinese, its ideographic writing system allows radicals to trigger semantic association without the need of phonetics. In fact, subconsciously using the associative information guided by radicals is a key for readers to ensure the robustness of semantic understanding. Fortunately, many basic and extended concepts related to radicals are systematically included in Chinese language dictionaries, which leaves a handy but unexplored way for improving Chinese text representation and classification. To this end, we draw inspirations from cognitive principles between ideography and human associative behavior to propose a novel Radical-guided Associative Model (RAM) for Chinese text classification. RAM comprises two coupled spaces, namely Literal Space and Associative Space, which imitates the real process in people's mind when understanding a Chinese text. To be specific, we first devise a serialized modeling structure in Literal Space to thoroughly capture the sequential information of Chinese text. Then, based on the authoritative information provided by Chinese language dictionaries, we design an association module and put forward a strategy called Radical-Word Association to use ideographic radicals as the medium to associate prior concept words in Associative Space. Afterwards, we design an attention module to imitate people's matching and decision between Literal Space and Associative Space, which can balance the importance of each associative words under specific contexts. Finally, extensive experiments on two real-world datasets prove the effectiveness and rationality of RAM, with good cognitive insights for future language modeling.

    Recent years, Chinese text
    classification has attracted more and more research
    attention. However, most existing techniques which
    specifically aim at English materials may lose effectiveness
    on this task due to the huge difference between
    Chinese and English. Actually, as a special kind of
    hieroglyphics, Chinese characters and radicals are
    semantically useful but still unexplored in the task of text
    classification. To that end, in this paper, we
    first analyze the motives of using multiple granularity
    features to represent a Chinese text
    by inspecting the characteristics of radicals, characters
    and words. For better representing the Chinese
    text and then implementing Chinese text classification, we
    propose a novel Radical-aware Attention-based
    Four-Granularity (RAFG) model to take full advantages of
    Chinese characters, words, character-level
    radicals, word-level radicals simultaneously. Specifically,
    RAFG applies a serialized BLSTM structure
    which is context-aware and able to capture the long-range
    information to model the character sharing
    property of Chinese and sequence characteristics in texts.
    Further, we design an attention mechanism to
    enhance the effects of radicals thus model the radical
    sharing property when integrating granularities.
    Finally, we conduct extensive experiments, where the
    experimental results not only show the superiority of
    our model, but also validate the effectiveness of radicals
    in the task of Chinese text classification

  Representation learning of examination papers is the cornerstone of
    the Examination Paper Analysis (EPA) in education area including
    Paper Difficulty Prediction (PDR) and Finding Similar Papers (FSP).
    Previous works mainly focus on the representation learning of each
    test item, but few works notice the hierarchical document structure
    in examination papers. To this end, in this paper, we propose a novel
    Examination Organization Encoder (EOE) to learn a robust representation of the examination paper with the hierarchical document
    structure. Specifically, we first propose a syntax parser to recover
    the hierarchical document structure and convert an examination
    paper to an Examination Organization Tree (EOT), where the test
    items are the leaf nodes and the internal nodes are summarization
    of their child nodes. Then, we applied a two-layer GRU-based module to obtain the representation of each leaf node. After that, we
    design a subtree encoder module to aggregate the representation
    of each leaf node, which is used to calculate an embedding for each
    layer in the EOT. Finally, we feed all the layer embedding into an
    output module, the process is over and we get the examination
    paper representation that can be used for downstream tasks. Extensive experiments on real-world data demonstrate the effectiveness
    and interpretability of our method.

  abstract={
    Word embedding is a basic and very important topic in the field of Natural Language Processing. For Chinese,
    which has the nature of pictographic representation, it is urgent to explore more interpretable strategies
    to capture the language patterns in which morphological information is used to convey semantics. In this
    paper, we elaborate that Chinese word embeddings can be substantially enhanced by the morphological
    information hidden in
    characters which is reflected not only in strokes order sequentially, but also in character glyphs
    spatially. Then, we propose a novel Dual-channel Word Embedding model to realize the joint learning of
    sequential and spatial information of Chinese
    characters, so as to further enrich the representation of words. Through the evaluation on both word
    similarity and word analogy

  abstract={
    Concept extraction aims to find words or phrases
    describing a concept from massive texts. Recently,
    researchers propose many neural network-based
    methods to automatically extract concepts. Although these methods for this task show promising results, they ignore structured information in
    the raw textual data (e.g., title, topic, and clue
    words). In this paper, we propose a novel model,
    named Guided Attention Concept Extraction Network (GACEN), which uses title, topic, and clue
    words as additional supervision to provide guidance directly. Specifically, GACEN comprises two
    attention networks, one of them is to gather the
    relevant title and topic information for each context word in the document. The other one aims to
    model the implicit connection between informative
    words (clue words) and concepts. Finally, we aggregate information from two networks as input to
    Conditional Random Field (CRF) to model dependencies in the output. We collected clue words for
    three well-studied datasets. Extensive experiments
    demonstrate that our model outperforms the baseline models with a large margin

  abstract={
    Cognitive diagnosis, aiming at providing an approach to reveal the
    proficiency level of learners on knowledge concepts, plays an important role in intelligent education area and has recently received
    more and more attention. Although a number of works have been
    proposed in recent years, most of contemporary works acquire
    the traits parameters of learners and items in a transductive way,
    which are only suitable for stationary data. However, in the real
    scenario, the data is collected online, where learners, test items and
    interactions usually grow continuously, which can rarely meet the
    stationary condition. To this end, we propose a novel framework,
    Incremental Cognitive Diagnosis (ICD), to tailor cognitive diagnosis into the online scenario of intelligent education. Specifically,
    we first design a Deep Trait Network (DTN), which acquires the
    trait parameters in an inductive way rather than a transductive
    way. Then, we propose an Incremental Update Algorithm (IUA) to balance the effectiveness and training efficiency. We carry out
    Turning Point (TP) analysis to reduce update frequency, where we
    derive the minimum update condition based on the monotonicity
    theory of cognitive diagnosis. Meanwhile, we use a momentum
    update strategy on the incremental data to decrease update time
    without sacrificing effectiveness. Moreover, to keep the trait parameters as stable as possible, we refine the loss function in the
    incremental updating stage. Last but no least, our ICD is a general
    framework which can be applied to most of contemporary cognitive
    diagnosis models. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
    attempt to investigate the incremental cognitive diagnosis problem
    with theoretical results about the update condition and a tailored
    incremental learning strategy. Extensive experiments demonstrate
    the effectiveness and robustness of our method.

    Cognitive diagnosis, a fundamental task in education area, aims at providing an approach to reveal the proficiency level of students on knowledge concepts. Actually, monotonicity is one of the basic conditions in cognitive diagnosis theory, which assumes that student's proficiency is monotonic with the probability of giving the right response to a test item. However, few of previous methods consider the monotonicity during optimization. To this end, we propose Item Response Ranking framework (IRR), aiming at introducing pairwise learning into cognitive diagnosis to well model the monotonicity between item responses. Specifically, we first use an item specific sampling method to sample item responses and construct response pairs based on their partial order, where we propose the two-branch sampling methods to handle the unobserved responses. After that, we use a pairwise objective function to exploit the monotonicity in the pair formulation. In fact, IRR is a general framework which can be applied to most of contemporary cognitive diagnosis models. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and interpretability of our method.

  abstract={
    Knowledge Tracing (KT) is a fundamental but challenging task in online education that traces learners' evolving knowledge states.
    Much attention has been drawn to this area and several works such as Bayesian and Deep Knowledge Tracing have been proposed.
    Recent works have explored the value of relations among concepts and proposed to introduce knowledge structure into KT tasks.
    However, the propagated influence among concepts, which has been shown to be a key factor in human learning by the educational theories, is still under-explored.
    In this paper, we propose a new framework called Structure-based Knowledge Tracing (SKT), which exploits the multiple relations in knowledge structure to model the influence propagation among concepts.
    In the SKT framework, we consider both the temporal effect on the exercising sequence and the spatial effect on the knowledge structure.
    We take advantages of two novel formulations in modeling the influence propagation on the knowledge structure with multiple relations.
    For undirected relations such as similarity relations, the synchronization propagation method is adopted, where the influence propagates bidirectionally between neighbor concepts.
    For directed relations such as prerequisite relations, the partial propagation method is applied, where the influence can only unidirectionally propagate from a predecessor to a successor.
    Meanwhile, we employ the gated functions to update the states of concepts temporally and spatially.
    We demonstrate the effectiveness and interpretability of SKT with extensive experiments.

    Adaptive learning, also known as adaptive teaching, relies
    on learning path recommendation,
    which sequentially recommends personalized learning items
    (e.g., lectures, exercises) to satisfy
    the unique needs of each learner. Although it is well known
    that modeling the cognitive structure including
    knowledge level of learners and knowledge structure (e.g.,
    the prerequisite relations)
    of learning items is important for learning path
    recommendation, existing methods for
    adaptive learning often separately focus on either knowledge
    levels of learners or knowledge structure
    of learning items. To fully exploit the multifaceted
    cognitive structure for learning path recommendation,
    in this paper, we propose a

    <b>S</b>tructure
    <b>E</b>nhanced
    framework
    <b>A</b>daptive
    <b>L</b>earning,
    named <b>CSEAL</b>.
    By viewing path recommendation as a Markov Decision Process
    (MDP) and applying an actor-critic algorithm, our framework
    can sequentially identify the right learning items to
    different learners. Specifically, we first utilize a
    recurrent neural network to
    trace the evolving knowledge levels of learners at each
    learning step. Then, we design a navigation algorithm on
    knowledge graph to
    ensure the logicality of learning paths, which can also
    reduce the search space in the decision process.
    Finally, the actor-critic algorithm is used to determine
    what to learn next, whose parameters are dynamically updated
    along the learning path. Extensive experiments with
    real-world data demonstrate the
    effectiveness and robustness of CSEAL in comparison with
    alternative approaches.

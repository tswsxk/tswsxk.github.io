                The research on music generation based on Recurrent Neural Network (RNN).
                The research is supported by College Students Innovation Plan and we got A score.
                <br>
                We implement a sequence model based on tensorflow, which can learn to generate the music sequence.

                EduSim is a platform for constructing simulation environments for education recommender systems (ERSs)
                that naturally supports sequential interaction with learners. Meanwhile, EduSim allows the creation of
                new environments that reflect particular aspects of learning elements, such as learning behavior of
                learners, knowledge structure of concepts and so on.

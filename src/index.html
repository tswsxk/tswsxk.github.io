            I am currently a postgraduate of computer science at
            <a href="https://www.ustc.edu.cn/"> University of Science
                and Technology of China</a>.
            I major in data mining at
            <a href="https://bigdata.ustc.edu.cn/">Anhui Province Key
                Laboratory of Big Data Analysis and
                Application</a>
            and my tutor is <a
                href="http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~qiliuql/">Dr. Qi Liu</a>.
        </p>

            My main research area is the data mining on the online education system.
            And my research interests include Deep Learning (<b>DL</b>),
            Knowledge Graph (<b>KG</b>), Natural Language Processing
            (<b>NLP</b>) and Reinforcement Learning (<b>RL</b>).
            By now, I already have four papers
            published in <b>AAAI'19</b>, <b>KDD'19</b> and so on.
            Also, I have four received patent
            and one is under review.
            I am in charge of several open source projects related to online education system,
            like Knowledge Tracing and Digital Twins for Education.
            I also develop a toolkit framework
            to quickly construct different architectures
            for different purposes,
            named <a
                href="https://longling.readthedocs.io/zh/latest/index.html">longling</a>,
            which is still in progress.
            Moreover, I am responsible for constructing education knowledge graphs
            <a href="https://kg-edu-frontend-43-production-v1.env.bdaa.pro">BASE-KG</a>
            for my laboratory.

            I am familiar with
            <b>python</b>, and know the basic grammar of
            <b>C</b>,
            <b>java</b>,
            <b>html</b>,
            <b>css</b>
            <b>javascript</b>.
            I grasp the basic usage of some common
            frameworks for development like
            <b>webpack</b>, <b>vue</b> in frontend,
            <b>flask</b> in backend and
            <b>beautifulsoup</b> for crawling.
            I have some experience on managing servers (CentOS)
            and database,
            knowing the basic usage of
            <b>mysql</b>,
            <b>neo4j</b>,
            <b>mongodb</b>, and
            <b>elasticsearch</b>.
            In addition, I know <b>git</b> and
            container technology like <b>Kubernetes</b> and <b>docker</b>.
            I used <b>kafka</b>, <b>thrift</b>,
            <b>spark</b> and
            <b>hive</b>
            but be out of practice currently.
            My most favorite machine learning frameworks are
            <a href="https://scikit-learn.org/">sklearn</a> and <a
                href="https://mxnet.apache.org/">mxnet</a>.

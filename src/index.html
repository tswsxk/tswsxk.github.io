            I am currently a postgraduate of computer science at
            <a href="https://www.ustc.edu.cn/"> University of Science
                and Technology of China</a>.
            I major in data mining at
            <a href="https://bigdata.ustc.edu.cn/">Anhui Province Key
                Laboratory of Big Data Analysis and
                Application</a>
            and my tutor is <a
                href="http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~qiliuql/">Prof. Qi Liu</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            My main research area is the data mining on the online education system
            and my research interests include Deep Learning (<b>DL</b>),
            Knowledge Graph (<b>KG</b>), Natural Language Processing
            (<b>NLP</b>) and Reinforcement Learning (<b>RL</b>).
            By now, I already have 12 <a href="research.html">papers</a>
            published in <b>KDD</b>, <b>AAAI</b>, <b>IJCAI</b>, <b>SIGIR</b>, <b>ICDM</b> and so on.
            At the same time, I serve as the PC member of IJCAI2021, IJCAI2022.
            Also, I have 8 public patents
            and one is under licensing announcement.
            I am in charge of several open source projects related to online education system:
            <a href="https://github.com/bigdata-ustc/EduData">EduData</a>,
            <a href="https://github.com/bigdata-ustc/EduCDM">EduCDM</a>,
            <a href="https://github.com/bigdata-ustc/EduKTM">EduKTM</a>,
            <a href="https://github.com/bigdata-ustc/EduNLP">EduNLP</a>,
            <a href="https://github.com/bigdata-ustc/EduSim">EduSim</a>,
            <a href="https://github.com/bigdata-ustc/EduRec">EduRec</a>.
            I also develop a toolkit framework
            to quickly construct different architectures
            for different purposes,
            named <a
                href="https://longling.readthedocs.io/zh/latest/index.html">longling</a>,
            which is still in progress.
            Moreover, I am responsible for constructing education knowledge graphs
            <a href="https://luna.bdaa.pro">LUNA</a>
            for my laboratory.

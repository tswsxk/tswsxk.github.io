                <p>
                    I am currently a postgraduate of computer science at
                    <a href="https://www.ustc.edu.cn/"> University of Science
                        and Technology of China</a>.
                    I major in data mining at
                    <a href="https://bigdata.ustc.edu.cn/">Anhui Province Key
                        Laboratory of Big Data Analysis and
                        Application</a>
                    and my tutor is <a
                        href="http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~qiliuql/">Dr. Qi Liu</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My research interests include Deep Learning (<b>DL</b>),
                    Knowledge Graph (<b>KG</b>), Natural Language Processing
                    (<b>NLP</b>) and Reinforcement Learning (<b>RL</b>).
                    By now, I already have two papers
                    published in <b>AAAI'19</b> and <b>KDD'19</b>,
                    and one related to NLP is under review.
                    Also, I have one received patent
                    and two are under review.
                    I also develop a toolkit framework
                    to quickly construct different architectures
                    for different purposes,
                    named <a
                        href="https://longling.readthedocs.io/zh/latest/index.html">longling</a>,
                    which is still in progress.
                    Recently, I am responsible for constructing knowledge graphs
                    for my laboratory.

                    I am familiar with
                    <b>python</b>, and know the basic grammar of
                    <b>java</b>,
                    <b>C</b>,
                    <b>html</b>,
                    <b>javascript</b>.
                    I grasp the basic usage of some common
                    frameworks for development like
                    <b>webpack</b>, <b>vue</b> in frontend,
                    <b>flask</b> in backend and
                    <b>beautifulsoup</b> for crawling.
                    I have some experience on managing servers (CentOS)
                    and database,
                    knowing the basic usage of
                    <b>mysql</b>,
                    <b>neo4j</b>,
                    <b>mongodb</b>, and
                    <b>elasticsearch</b>.
                    In addition, I used
                    <b>spark</b> and
                    <b>hive</b>
                    but be out of practice currently.
                    My most favorite machine learning frameworks are
                    <a href="https://scikit-learn.org/">sklearn</a> and <a

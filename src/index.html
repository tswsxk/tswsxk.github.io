                    I am currently a postgraduate of computer science at
                    <a href="https://www.ustc.edu.cn/"> University of Science
                        and Technology of China</a>.
                    I major in data mining at
                    <a href="https://bigdata.ustc.edu.cn/">Anhui Province Key
                        Laboratory of Big Data Analysis and
                        Application</a>
                    and my tutor is <a

                    My research interests include deep learning (DL), knowledge
                    graph (KG) and natural language processing
                    (NLP). My most favorite frameworks are
                    <a href="https://scikit-learn.org/">sklearn</a> and <a
                        href="https://mxnet.apache.org/">mxnet</a>.
                    I also develop a wrapper framework for mxnet,
                    named <a
                        href="https://pypi.org/project/longling/">longling</a>,
                    which is still in progress.

                    I am familiar with Python, and know the basic grammar of
                    java, C, html and javascript.
                    I have some experience on constructing website such as wiki
                    and managing servers (CentOS).
                    I also know the basic usage of mysql, neo4j and
                    elasticsearch.
                    In addition, I used spark and hive but be out of practice
                    currently.

            Adaptive learning, also known as adaptive teaching, relies
            on learning path recommendation,
            which sequentially recommends personalized learning items
            (e.g., lectures, exercises) to satisfy
            the unique needs of each learner. Although it is well known
            that modeling the cognitive structure including
            knowledge level of learners and knowledge structure (e.g.,
            the prerequisite relations)
            of learning items is important for learning path
            recommendation, existing methods for
            adaptive learning often separately focus on either knowledge
            levels of learners or knowledge structure
            of learning items. To fully exploit the multifaceted
            cognitive structure for learning path recommendation,
            in this paper, we propose a
            <b>C</b>ognitive
            <b>S</b>tructure
            <b>E</b>nhanced
            framework
            <b>A</b>daptive
            <b>L</b>earning,
            named <b>CSEAL</b>.
            By viewing path recommendation as a Markov Decision Process
            (MDP) and applying an actor-critic algorithm, our framework
            can sequentially identify the right learning items to
            different learners. Specifically, we first utilize a
            recurrent neural network to
            trace the evolving knowledge levels of learners at each
            learning step. Then, we design a navigation algorithm on
            knowledge graph to
            ensure the logicality of learning paths, which can also
            reduce the search space in the decision process.
            Finally, the actor-critic algorithm is used to determine
            what to learn next, whose parameters are dynamically updated
            along the learning path. Extensive experiments with
            real-world data demonstrate the
            effectiveness and robustness of CSEAL in comparison with
            alternative approaches.

            Recent years, Chinese text
            classification has attracted more and more research
            attention. However, most existing techniques which
            specifically aim at English materials may lose effectiveness
            on this task due to the huge difference between
            Chinese and English. Actually, as a special kind of
            hieroglyphics, Chinese characters and radicals are
            semantically useful but still unexplored in the task of text
            classification. To that end, in this paper, we
            first analyze the motives of using multiple granularity
            features to represent a Chinese text
            by inspecting the characteristics of radicals, characters
            and words. For better representing the Chinese
            text and then implementing Chinese text classification, we
            propose a novel Radical-aware Attention-based
            Four-Granularity (RAFG) model to take full advantages of
            Chinese characters, words, character-level
            radicals, word-level radicals simultaneously. Specifically,
            RAFG applies a serialized BLSTM structure
            which is context-aware and able to capture the long-range
            information to model the character sharing
            property of Chinese and sequence characteristics in texts.
            Further, we design an attention mechanism to
            enhance the effects of radicals thus model the radical
            sharing property when integrating granularities.
            Finally, we conduct extensive experiments, where the
            experimental results not only show the superiority of
            our model, but also validate the effectiveness of radicals
            in the task of Chinese text classification

            Word embedding is a basic and very important topic in the field of Natural Language Processing. For Chinese,
            which has the nature of pictographic representation, it is urgent to explore more interpretable strategies
            to capture the language patterns in which morphological information is used to convey semantics. In this
            paper, we elaborate that Chinese word embeddings can be substantially enhanced by the morphological
            information hidden in
            characters which is reflected not only in strokes order sequentially, but also in character glyphs
            spatially. Then, we propose a novel Dual-channel Word Embedding model to realize the joint learning of
            sequential and spatial information of Chinese
            characters, so as to further enrich the representation of words. Through the evaluation on both word
            similarity and word analogy
            task, our model significantly outperforms other baseline methods and shows great interpretability.
